this is a bit of doggoral but it will allow me to doggedly persue my aim of cataloguing the effect of applying a word filter the filter should pick out words such as cat dog and aim who knows what other pernicious words it will endeavour to protect the innocent from there is no punctuation in order to make it easier to identify the words and i have also written it entirely in lower case you will feel like a dog if you do not manage the aim of this assignment but i expect everyone to be top cat first some background since much of the book is about the consequences of punk it is necessary to begin with some kind of working definition of the term the grim duty of any writer of introductions as most readers will be aware punk is a notoriously amorphous concept yet bearing in mind that words tend to mean what theyve come to mean we can work backwards-in a sense-to try to fix certain essentials thus at a very basic level we can say that punk wasis a subculture best characterised as being part youth rebellion part artistic statement it had its high point from 1976 to 1979 and was most visible in britain and america it had its primary manifestation in music-and specifically in the disaffected rock and roll of bands like the sex pistols and the clash philosophically it had no set agenda like the hippy movement that preceded it but nevertheless stood for identifiable attitudes among them an emphasis on negationism rather than nihilism a consciousness of class-based politics with a stress on workingclass credibility and a belief in spontaneity and doing it yourself because gallands version founds its way into many oral traditions aladdin has come to constitute its own tale type-atu 561-in the classification system used by folklorists although a simpler form is represented by tale type atu 560 the magic ring which provides the basic intrigue the tales basic structure is very close to a fairy tale a poor young man with the aid of a magic object builds a palace more beautiful than that of the king and marries a princess when he loses them thanks to a second magic object he manages to recover everything he has lost the hero aladdin is described as a bad sort-undisciplined lazy and responsible for the death of his father and the misery of his mother at the beginning he does no good deed that would qualify him to obtain a magic object or to marry a princess but he is without hypocrisy he succeeds and in the end he becomes good and wise as the hills draw nearer one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance but there is no road by which to escape them across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region it is not reassuring to see on a closer glance that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge yet there is no way to avoid it once across it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint malign odour about the village street as of the massed mould and decay of centuries it is always a relief to get clear of the place and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwich
