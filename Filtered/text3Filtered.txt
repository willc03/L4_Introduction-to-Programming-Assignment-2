Because Galland's version founds its way into many oral traditions, "Ala*din" has come to constitute its own tale type-ATU 561-in the classific*tion system used by folklorists (although a simpler form is represented by tale type ATU 560, The Magic Ring, which provides the basic intrigue). The tale's basic structure is very close to a fairy tale: a poor young man, with the aid of a magic object, builds a palace more beautiful than that of the king and marries a princess; when he loses them, thanks to a second magic object, he manages to recover everything he has lost. The hero Ala*din is described as a bad sort-undisciplined, lazy, and responsible for the death of his father and the misery of his mother. At the beginning, he does no good deed that would qualify him to obtain a magic object or to marry a princess. But he is without hypocrisy; he succeeds, and in the end he becomes good and wise.
