First, some b**kground. Since much of the book is about the consequences of p**k, it is necessary to begin with some kind of working definition of the term (the grim duty of any writer of introductions). As most readers will be aware, 'p**k' is a notoriously amorphous concept. Yet, be*ring in mind that words tend to mean 'what they've come to mean', we can work b**kwards-in a sense-to try to fix certain essentials. Thus, at a very basic level, we can say that p**k was/is a subculture best characterised as being part youth rebellion, part artistic statement. It had its high point from 1976 to 1979, and was most visible in Britain and America. It had its primary manifestation in music-and specifically in the disaffected rock and roll of bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash. Philosophically, it had no 'set agenda' like the hippy movement that preceded it, but nevertheless stood for identifia**e attitudes, among them: an emphasis on negationism (rather than nihilism); a consciousness of class-based politics (with a stress on 'workingclass credibility'); and a belief in spontaneity and 'doing it yourself'.
